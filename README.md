Octocats
--------

I have created two Octocats like the ones you can see on [Octodex](http://octodex.github.com/) based on the [original Octocat](http://octodex.github.com/original/), these are made just for fun. For the legal things please see the [Octodex FAQ page](http://octodex.github.com/faq.html).

### github_octocat_cheshire_cat_original.svg
This Octocat is based on the Cheshire Cat from [Alice in Wonderland from 1951](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1951_film)).

### github_octocat_cheshire_cat_new.svg
This Octocat is based on the Cheshire Cat from [Alice in Wonderland from 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(2010_film)), the "Tim Burton version".
